## Introduction

This repository serves as a collaborative space for all lab members to store, share, and develop code and data-related projects. Whether you're working on a solo project, contributing to a group effort, or using shared datasets, this repository is the place to manage and streamline our lab's computational work.

## Usage

Each lab member can:
- Upload their individual projects.
- Collaborate on other members' projects.
- Share and access common data resources.
- Review and comment on code to improve quality and functionality.

## Contributing

We encourage all lab members to contribute actively. To do so, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Fork the Repository:** Create a personal copy of the repository.
2. **Create a Branch:** Use a descriptive name for your branch (e.g., `feature-add-analysis-tool`).
3. **Commit Changes:** Make changes to your branch and commit with clear, concise messages.
4. **Push to Branch:** Push your changes to your forked repository.
5. **Create a Pull Request:** Submit a pull request to the main repository for review.

Please adhere to the following:

- Keep commits atomic; one feature or bug fix per commit.
- Write clear and detailed commit messages.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following structure:

```
/project-name
  /data
    - raw
    - processed
  /scripts
    - analysis
    - preprocessing
  /notebooks
  /results
README.md
```

- **/project-name:** Each project should have its own directory named after the project.
- **/data:** Contains raw and processed data.
- **/scripts:** Contains scripts for analysis and preprocessing.
- **/notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis and development.
- **/results:** Output results such as figures, tables, and reports.

## Data Management

Data should be organized into the `data` directory within your project folder:
- **raw:** Unprocessed data files.
- **processed:** Data files that have been cleaned or transformed for analysis.

Always ensure data integrity and follow ethical guidelines for data usage and sharing.
